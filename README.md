Created by **Croix Raney, Isaiah Guilfoile, and Thomas Hinkley** for EE 2361, Spring 2023

Light the Beam is an original game where the player is tasked with aiming a red laser beam to a small shining target. If the user is successful, they will be alerted via a celebratory lightshow! The laser is mounted on a servo motor controlled by a joystick, giving the player full control of its movements. All components are mounted in a box that creates a challenging distance between the laser's origin and the target.
