I am getting a value from RDATAH high register consistently but it is not changing, I am making a new function to exit the wait state to see if that is the reason the register is not updating (Isaiah, Apr 14 3:33 pm)

exitWait function is not fixing the problem so I'm working on a function that reads all 16 bits from the red registers to maybe end the data hold discussed on pg 19 of the sensor Datasheet (Isaiah, Apr 14 4:04 pm)
